# 42_Cpp_Module_03

The goal of the **C++ modules 00 to 08** is to introduce the student to Object-Oriented Programming and the C++ programming language in general.
Because of the complexity of the language, the students code has to comply with the C++98 standard.

**C++ module 03** introduces the learner to the fundamental OOP concept of inheritance.

## Description

ex00:  
Implement a specific robot class named ClapTrap, that will later be used as a parent class for other Trap-like robots.  
(orthodox canonical class form)

ex01:  
Implement a ScavTrap class, that derives from the ClapTrap class and inherits ClapTrap's constructors and destructors. Some of the member function are the same as in the ClapTrap class, but work differently.  
(first, simple intro to inheritance)

ex02:  
Implement a FragTrap class, inheriting from ClapTrap class. Constructor and destructor have to be different from ClapTrap class.  
(understanding how constructors & destructors work between related classes)

ex03:  
Implement a DiamondTrap, that is a ClapTrap, but also inherits from ScavTrap AND FragTrap.  
(understanding 'Diamond/Multiple Inheritance')

## Learnings

Nice refresher for inheritance in OOP, and especially my first contact with the concept of 'Diamond Inheritance'.
